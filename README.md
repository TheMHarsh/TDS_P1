# Tools in Data Science - Project 1

- I scraped the data using the GitHub API to gather information about developers from Zurich who have more than 50 followers. After that, I cleaned and saved the data in CSV files for further analysis.

- The most surprising fact I found was that the majority of developers work at Google, which fascinated me considering Google is considered hard to get into. I was also surprised that BitBake is the language with the highest average number of stars per repository, as I had never even heard of it.

- An actionable recommendation for developers is to create repositories with detailed documentation and enable project and wiki features, as they are correlated with higher engagement and visibility.
